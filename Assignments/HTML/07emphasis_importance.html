    <h1>Brain Power</h1>
    <p>
       In 2013, Japan's K computer performed the largest nuronal network<br>
       simulation ever attempted, and managed to mimic human brain activity<br>
       for a <strong>single second</strong>. The simulation represented <em>only about 1%</em> of the<br>
       brain's neuronal network, connectiong 1.73 billion virtual nerve cells<br>
       to trillions of virtual synapses. The K computer is the fourth-fastest<br>
       computer in the world, but its impressive stats seem to pale in<br>
       comparison to the thinking power of our organic gray mattter.<br>
       The simulation took <em>82,944 processors</em> and <strong>40 minutes</strong>.
