      <p>A Web Development Final Project by David Larsen<br> Â© David Larsen 2018<br></p><p class="simonsenSaid">Going into this class, I knew some of the basics of html and css, but had never really put them into practice. So, going through this class was a refresher on those basics as well as an opportunity to learn how to use those languages to make a finished product. I learned quite a bit doing the final project, since I had to take the mostly theoretical knowledge that the class had given me prior and actually put it to use.<br>Going into this, I had no idea about anything to do with javascript, so it was a little bit intimidating to go through some of the assignments, but I feel like I learned a good bit about how javascript works, and I'm glad for the experience. I think the biggest thing I learned, besides all the syntax stuff, was that if you have some issue or problem you can't solve, there are resources available to help you find the answer.</p>
